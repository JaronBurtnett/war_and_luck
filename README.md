# war_and_luck

This project is a learning experience and came out of a story idea I had. It plays the game war for you aginst an oponent and tracks all the cards played. Part 2 takes the output from the original game and allows you to select a play during the game and play one of their cards out of order. It then tracks that game and allows you to see how changing that one card affected the outcome.

I have plans to give it a GUI and put the full game together into one file. Part of splitting it up was just practice for me.
